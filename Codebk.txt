Project Instructions:
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Data
Data was derived from the “Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones” Dataset
Provided from Smartlab – Non Linear Complex Systems Lab
Data consists of recordings taken from 30 subjects in 6 activities using Smartphone gyro/accelerometer attached to subject waist.  3 axial linear acceleration and angular velocity were captured at a 50 HZ rate.  Sensor signals were pre-processed with noise filters, sampled, corrected and processed through mathematical transformations (Euclidean Norm and Fast Fourier Transform).  Specifics are described in the HCI data readme and the features_info file.
Resulting files used contained:
	'README.txt'

	'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

	'features.txt': List of all features measured.  No units provided.
Ex:  1 tBodyAcc-mean()-X,    2 tBodyAcc-mean()-Y and 559 more described in txt file.

	'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
i.e.  1 Walking, 2 Walking Upstairs, 3 Walking Downstairs, 4 Sitting, 5 Standing, 6 Laying

	'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

	'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
	‘test/X_test.txt’:  Test set.

	‘test/y_test.txt’: Test labels
The subjects were broken into 2 groups: 75% in the train group and 25% in the test group.  The main data set – numerical recordings – were contained in the X_test/train files which contained 561 variables.  These are described in the features.txt file.  Training/Test labels determined subject and activity was pulled from activity txt file.  
Data cleaning and Processing
Data was read into Rstudio and checked for reasonableness. A thorough description of the R coding is contained in the readme file.  R script is in ‘run_analysis.R’.
Essentially, the test and train data (X_...  files) were read into dataframes.  Added to each was the subjects and activities into 2 dataframes (test/train).  The ‘features.txt’ contained a column of variable names.  These character names were extracted and added to test/train dataframes as column names, along with ‘subject’ and ‘activity’ for the 1st two columns.
These two df were then merged into one combined dataframe containing all observations.  Assignment called for extracting observed variables containing ‘mean’ or ‘standard deviation.’  Using R functions (grep), we received the indices of the columns necessary, and used them to subset into a new dataframe.  Activity code numbers were replaced with descriptive names.
Finally, analysis was done to manipulate previous data frame as per instructions: providing new dataframe with the average value for each subject/activity.  The final independent df had dim of 180 x 92.  That is, 180 rows (30 subjects x 6 activities) and columns for subject, activity, and 90 mean/std value feature variables.
